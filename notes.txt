nest 
under the hood 
1. Nest js makes use of robust HTTP server frameworks (default Expressjs )
2.  It provides a level of abstraction above these frameworks,
 which makes it incredibly joyful to code in TS. However, it still expose the original APIs dirctly to the devloper.


Why nest js 
 1. The rise of populor web technologies such as Angular, React ,vue has massively improved the development experience.
 2. however, while Node.Js has plently of great  libraries, none of them effectivly solve the main problem of architecture
 3. NestJs provides an out-of-the-box application architecture which allows developers and teams to create highly testable,
  scalable, loosely coupled and easy to maintain applications.

 3. It is possible to gerate a project and genrate schematics in project using cli. this leaves almost no room for mistakes in teams of projects struture.
 4. using cli its also save time for writing boiler plate code.
